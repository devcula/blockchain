Add transaction fees into each transaction.

Instead of using pending transactions array for mining, compute merkel root.

Declare API callback functions in separate file so that they can be used internally as well.

Check if mining reward and transaction fees are part of the same block or they need to be mined separately.

After registering and broadcasting a new network node, send the entire blockchain to the new node as well. (For this consensus algorithm can be used)
